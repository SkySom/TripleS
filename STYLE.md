# Style Guide
## Version 1.0

All contributions to TripleS will conform to [The D Style](http://dlang.org/dstyle.html) 
with the following exceptions:

* Use tabs instead of spaces for identing lines. Use spaces when aligning statements or 
  otherwise using whitespace.
* Constants and enum members have UPPERCASE names.

"The D Style" is considered authoritative otherwise, though will not be strictly enforced 
unless leniency is abused.
